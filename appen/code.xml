  <strong>Experiment to investigate factors that play a role in understanding the distance between the car and cyclist</strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
   In this experiment, you will watch several videos and imagine yourself as the vehicle's driver. You will be asked to answer questions based on your feelings about the interactions and the distance from the cyclist. All videos feature manually driven cars. Please focus on your perspective as the driver when assessing the proximity and interactions between the vehicle and the cyclist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>Important:</strong> You will be asked to leave Appen to participate in the experiment. You will need to open the link below. Do not close this tab. At the end of the experiment, you will be given a code to input in the next question on this tab. Please take a note of the code. Without the code, you will not be able to receive money for your participation. All videos will be downloaded before the start of the experiment. It may take a few minutes. Please do not close your browser during that time.
