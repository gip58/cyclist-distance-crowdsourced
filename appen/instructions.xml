<p>To participate in this study you must be at least 18 years old. Your participation in this research project does not involve any physical, legal or economic risks. Participation in this research project is voluntary: the decision to take part is up to you. Before you decide to participate, we would like to ask you to read the following information, so that you know what the research project is about, what we expect from you and how we deal with processing your personal data. You may of course always contact the investigator at the above email address, if you have any questions.</p>

<p>You will be taking part in a research project in which we will gather information via an experiment where you will see multiple videos. The experiment will take approximately 45 minutes of your time. Before the study starts, the videos will be preloaded. This may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection. In case you participated in a previous experiment of one of the present investigators, your responses may be combined with the previous experiment. You may end your participation at any moment you choose. You do not have to explain why you decided to end your participation in the research project. If you would not like to participate, then please close this page.</p>

<p>Within the framework of the research project, we process the following personal data: age, gender, email address (optional), location based on IP address, age of obtaining a driving license, eye-tracking data, information on your usage of a car and your behaviour whilst operating a car, information on your attitudes and usage towards technology. The legal basis upon which we process your data is our consent. We will do everything we can to protect your privacy as best as possible. The research results that will be published will not in any way contain confidential information or personal data from or about you through which anyone can recognise you. The personal data that was gathered via the online experiment and other documents within the framework of this research project will be stored on TU/e-recommended storage. No video recording of eye tracking will be saved. The answers you provide via questionnaire will be stored for 10 years. The research data will, if necessary (e.g., for a check on scientific integrity) and only in an anonymous form, be made available to people outside the research group.</p>
